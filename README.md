This is a simple game made in Construct 3, as part of my Games Technology Level 3 course. It had to meet some certain requirements set by the college, which are listed here:
1) The game has to be 2D
2) The prompt for the game is **Sheep**
3) It must be a platformer game </br>
</p>With all those requirements set out, I set out to brainstorm some ideas!</br>
Ideas ranged from a myltiplayer competitive game, like Smash, to a simple story driven game, about a gaelic shepherd. However, I settled on a bullet hell!
